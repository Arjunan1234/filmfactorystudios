2. Scroll down to **Upload presets** section
3. Click **Add upload preset**
4. Configure the preset:
   - **Preset name**: Choose a name (e.g., `photo-upload`)

   - **Format**: Leave as Auto
   - **Quality**: Set to Auto or your preferred quality
   - **Transformation**: Add any default transformations if needed
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Configure Your Application
Update the file `/src/lib/cloudinary.js` with your actual values:

const CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET = 'photo-upload'; // Replace with your upload preset name
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration

## üîê Security Considerations

### Upload Preset Security:
- **Unsigned presets** are used for simplicity in this setup
- For production, consider using **signed uploads** with backend validation
- Set appropriate **folder structure** and **file size limits**

### Recommended Production Setup:
1. Create a backend API endpoint for signed uploads
2. Implement file type validation on server
3. Add user authentication before upload
4. Set up automatic image optimization

## üìä Database Schema Integration

The uploaded images are automatically saved to your Supabase `photos` table with:
- `title`: User-defined or auto-generated title
- `url`: Cloudinary secure URL
- `category_id`: Selected category
- `created_at`: Upload timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last modified timestamp

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements:
1. **Image Editing**: Add crop/resize functionality
2. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple photos for batch actions
3. **Search**: Add photo search functionality
4. **Metadata**: Store additional EXIF data
5. **Optimization**: Implement responsive image delivery

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Upload Fails**: Check cloud name and upload preset in `cloudinary.js`
2. **CORS Errors**: Ensure upload preset is set to "Unsigned"
3. **Large Files**: Verify file size is under 10MB limit
4. **Network Issues**: Check internet connection and Cloudinary status

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Cloudinary dashboard shows failed uploads
3. Test with smaller image files
4. Confirm Supabase connection is working

## üí° Tips
- **Image Optimization**: Cloudinary automatically optimizes images
- **Transformations**: Use Cloudinary's URL parameters for on-the-fly transformations
- **Backup**: Consider setting up automatic backups of your Cloudinary media
